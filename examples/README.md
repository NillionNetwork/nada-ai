# Examples

The following are the currently available examples:

- [Linear Regression](./linear_regression): shows how to run a linear regression using Nada AI
- [Neural Net](./neural_net): shows how to build & run a simple Feed-Forward Neural Net (both linear layers & activations) using Nada AI
- [Complex Model](./complex_model): shows how to build more intricate model architectures using Nada AI. Contains convolutions, pooling operations, linear layers and activations
- [Time Series](./time_series): shows how to run a Facebook Prophet time series forecasting model using Nada AI

The Nada program source code is stored in `src/main.py`.

In order to follow the end-to-end example, head to `network/compute.py`. You can run it by simply running `nada build` to build the Nada program followed by `python network/compute.py`.
