# Spam detection

To execute this tutorial, you may potentially need to install the `requirements.txt` apart from nada-ai:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run this test:

0. Make sure all the dependencies are installed.
1. Run `cd examples/spam_detection` to changed directory.
2. Then, we can create our local devnet with: `bootstrap-nillion-devnet`. This command produces a local environment file `.env` file in the specific directory. So make sure to execute it in the specific directory.
2. Compile the project using `nada build`.
3. Run through the model provider script.
4. Run through the client script.
