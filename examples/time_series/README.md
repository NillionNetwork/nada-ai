# Time series Tutorial

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NillionNetwork/nada-ai/blob/main/examples/time_series/time_series.ipynb)

This example shows how you can run time series forecasting using Nada AI. It highlights that, although there exists a major parallel between Nada AI's design and that of PyTorch, it also integrates with other frameworks such as in this case `prophet`

You will find the nada program in `src/time_series.py`

## üö® Limitations
The choice for blind computing implies certain trade-offs in comparison to conventional computing. What you gain in privacy, you pay in extra computational overhead & capacity constraints.

Therefore, you will notice that large-scale computational workloads may lead to long compilation and/or execution times or hitting network capacity guardrails.

That said, the Nillion team is working around the clock to push the boundaries of this technology and bring the potential of blind computing to reality üöÄ

üëâ This example has been tested on local devnet for time series up to 25 elements and a forecasting horizon of up to 5 periods.
